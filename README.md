# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development
on macOS (M1).

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest terminal emulator
for macOS.

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with
  [znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap)

- Neovim on its [master branch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master)
  for programming, writing, and (almost) everything else I do on the command
  line

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) +
  [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) to manage sessions

- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), a lean file manager

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use Git

## GUI

- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for tiling window management
  (no space management on M1 yet, but still a necessity)

- [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) for system-wide keyboard shortcuts
  (and controlling yabai)
