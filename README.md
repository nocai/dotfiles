# dotfiles

My dotfiles for Neovim, zsh, tmux, and friends, optimized for web development
on macOS (M1).

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), the sanest terminal emulator
for macOS.

- zsh + a handful of plugins managed with
  [znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap)

- Neovim on its [master branch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master)
  for programming, writing, and (almost) everything else I do on the command
  line

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) +
  [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) to manage sessions

- [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), a lean file manager

- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), the least painful way to
  use Git

## GUI

- Firefox with [Surfingkeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys), the most
  reasonable compromise I've found between having to develop (and use) modern
  websites and wanting keyboard control

- [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst), a simple tiling window manager
  that works well on M1

- [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to remap
  keys
